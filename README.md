# BopBurger - Sequelized Edition!
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a Sequelize.

## Description and Use
This is a full stack application using both front end (HTML/CSS) and back end (Node, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, and MySQL).

The user will see burgers available and burgers that have been devoured. There will also be an input field for the user to enter a new burger to be added to the available ones. When added, the burger is placed as a new entry into the MySQL database. If the user decides to devour/eat the burger, he/she must click on one of the available burgers to do change its state to being devoured. Doing so will also update the database on the change.
